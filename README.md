# Matrix-Infinite-Loop
This project creates a "Matrix rain" effect using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. It simulates the iconic falling green code from The Matrix movies.

**Endless Loop:** The animation runs continuously, creating an endless stream of falling characters.
**Dense Rain:** The code features a high density of falling "lanes" for a visually rich effect.
**Customizable:** Parameters like font size, speed, and color can be easily adjusted in the code.
**Fullscreen Mode:** A button allows users to toggle the animation into fullscreen mode for a more immersive experience.
